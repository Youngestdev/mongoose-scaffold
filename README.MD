# Mongoose-Scaffold

```bash
npm i -g mongoose-scaffold 
```

A simple CLI tool to generate mongoose schemas for lazy developers.

> It's still under development ( version __0.0.1__ ). So basically it creates a new schema file with the dummy data added from the source code. The next feature will add a comprehensive command line prompt where the user can input the variables to be included in the schema.


## Usage

From the command line:

```bash
mongoose-scaffold --create <filename-without.js>
```

It generates the file in the current working direction with some dummy data, you should edit them to your taste.

## Todos

- Add features that allows user input their own data.
- Add more dummy data.
- Add a less or more option that'll determine the amount of dummy data.
- Add authentication support e.g Joi etc.
- Write tests ( that's in the future, lol ).

## Contributing

Well, this is a very basic project and it's very very open to contribution. Just:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a new branch with the feature name
3. Work on it and send a PR!
